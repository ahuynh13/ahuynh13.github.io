        A rat reveals itself through a small hole in the wall, carefully yet quickly darting its way around the parade of shoes that sheepishly mop across the floor heading towards the stairs. Every,couple seconds or so, a person will notice the
        rat and fearfully attempt to kick it; however, for the most part the rat remains oblivious to the kicks, and continues along with its journey towards the next hole it can venture into.Now if we further examine, most people noticed the rat
        scurrying along but were simply inattentive. They have their own worries and this common occurrence simply wasn’t enough. This apathetic approach understandably perplexes the people who view NYC as a step in their life rather than their forever home yet it makes perfect sense.

        New York City is a very bizarre city. It’s the home to landmarks, things, places and events that take place that wouldn’t happen anywhere else or at least receive a frown or two anywhere else. This characteristic can often repel someone from moving here or even visiting and having a
        positive experience and most likely it’s due to the person's preference for the safety and dullness of their current location. People who visit are often reeled in and enjoy the tourist attractions that make the city so famous, yet almost never stay long enough to experience the traits
        that make the city so unique, spectacular, and bizarre. That’s where this subway station with this curious rat scurrying along comes in despite the abnormality of the situation. It’s the revolting cases such as the rat that unknowingly build a unique and strangely enough beautiful experience
        for the person who calls themselves a New Yorker. People who visit are sometimes aware of these events and will often do as much as possible to avoid them; taking Ubers instead of the subway and avoiding the so called “dangerous streets,” oblivious to the fact that those experiences are often
        just as entertaining than the skyscrapers and the bronze bulls they flock to see.

        The subway I feel is where the “underground NYC” takes place where you can experience first hand what New York truly is. The spot that revealed it to me is my very own Grand Street. Located on the edge of Chinatown, nestled comfortably between two parks, is the place where
        I experienced and learned about New York. It’s the place where despite them being unusual; beautiful experiences were made for me and I’m sure for many others. The rat mentioned earlier is probably my favorite one, however so much more compete for that spot; the old man who
        was playing a Gu-Zheng at 1:00 am with a hat seemingly desperate for money despite no one being around, or the time when there was flash flooding so walking up the stairs that were being bombarded with sewer water became almost impossible. These unappealing things to me have
        remarkably had an impact on being here and made me appreciate things I took for granted like simply living here. Of course, you don’t need these astonishing cases to still appreciate the city, along with the flooding and the rat, Grand Street is where I’ve acknowledged the melting
        pot of NYC as I’ve admired people heading to work ready for the day, unfazed by anything that could concern them. I often try to convince friends visiting to move out of their comfort zone and experience the “true NYC” although, to my disappointment, most are reluctant.
        However so, there are people who have lived here their whole lives who haven’t experienced this and for that I question them on how they can call themselves a real New Yorker; the city is full of so many unique things hidden in plain sight, such as the subway that people
        sadly don’t get to experience and by doing so miss out on some real fun.
